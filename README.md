# Duplicate-Detection
Near-Duplicate Detection (Naive Algorithm)
The test data is also attached in 'test-data.zip' file
the duplicate or near duplicate files are as follows:
        "file01.txt and file02.txt",
        "file01.txt and file03.txt",
        "file02.txt and file03.txt",
        "file15.txt and file70.txt",
        "file07.txt and file09.txt",
        "file07.txt and file11.txt",
        "file09.txt and file11.txt",
        "file20.txt and file21.txt",
        "file20.txt and file22.txt",
        "file20.txt and file23.txt",
        "file21.txt and file22.txt",
        "file21.txt and file23.txt",
        "file22.txt and file23.txt",
        "file80.txt and file81.txt",
        "file80.txt and file82.txt",
        "file80.txt and file83.txt",
        "file80.txt and file84.txt",
        "file81.txt and file82.txt",
        "file81.txt and file83.txt",
        "file81.txt and file84.txt",
        "file82.txt and file83.txt",
        "file82.txt and file84.txt",
        "file83.txt and file84.txt",
        "file65.txt and file66.txt",
        "file65.txt and file67.txt",
        "file65.txt and file68.txt",
        "file38.txt and file65.txt",
        "file65.txt and file72.txt",
        "file66.txt and file67.txt",
        "file66.txt and file68.txt",
        "file66.txt and file72.txt",
        "file38.txt and file66.txt",

        "file68.txt and file72.txt",
        "file38.txt and file68.txt",
        "file38.txt and file72.txt"
